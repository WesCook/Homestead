# Homestead

Homestead is a TFC-inspired modpack, with a focus on revamped early-game survival, unique farming and food mechanics, and enhanced difficulty from the standard game.

The pack is available for download through the [ATLauncher](https://www.atlauncher.com/pack/Homestead).  Issues should be reported to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/WesCook/Homestead/issues).

This repo maintains a list of configs for the pack.
